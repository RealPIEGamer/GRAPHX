## Error Codes

Error codes are super important for debugging and finding answers online, so we provided them here! We reccomend you use this as a guide if you decide to modularize your project.

```md
E001: The file was unable to be located.
E002: Something was unimplemented or deprecated.
```

The `UNKNOWN` error concludes that we were not able to find the error, this is very unlikely to see.
